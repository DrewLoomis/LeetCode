two-sum logic is looping through all possible combinations of a nums array to find a target value made up of some value
x and y. 

Brute force:
double for loop to loop through check the first value i with every other value j and then i++ to continue until reaching the
end of the array

Hashmap:
Since hashmaps use a key/value pairing we can use that to make the search for the possible combinations quicker by setting the
key = array value and the hashmap value = array position of that value.

2nd iteration:
first for loop to create hashmap and 2nd for loop to loop and check for combinations that work

3rd iteration:
Since we can use if logic to simply check if the y value we are looking for exists in the hashmap we can cut out the 2nd for loop
since we use logic of:

for i in length of nums:
  y = target - nums[i]
  check for y in hashmap
    if true then return values:
  otherwise loop and set new hashvalue for i

return empty array
