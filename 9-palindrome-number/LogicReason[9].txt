palindrome number is all about simplying finding if the given number x is a palindrome (same when reversed) 
example of this is 121 but -1221 would be 1221-.

First interation:
by converting x into a string we can then just use reverse string logic in python stringx[::-1] to reverse a string
and then compare the current str(x) to the reversed string and return true or false

second interation:

Used javascript but can be done with an langauge. 
By not converting to a string we can use remainder logic and while looping through the number we can reverse it. This
does require extra of logic to check for negatives and also for numbers less than 10.

xcopy = x //creates copy
reverse = 0
while x > 0:
  reverse = (reverse * 10) + (x % 10)
  x //= 10
return reverse == xcopy

logic: 
x = 121
reverse = 0
reverse*10 = 0
x % 10 = 1
reverse + x = 1

x = 12
reverse = 1
reverse * 10 = 10
x % 10 = 2
reverse + x = 12

x = 1
reverse = 12
reverse*10 = 120
x % 10 = 1
reverse + x = 121
