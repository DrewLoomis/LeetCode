Roman to Integer is using a hashmap to convert the roman numerals to the correct numbers we use. There is some extra math involved 
where if the number you are currently at is less than the next number in the sequence then you need to subtract and then add.

Ex: IV = 4 I = 1, V = 5 | V - I = 4

Otherwise we are just adding sequentially based on order from left to right.

'I':1
'V':5
'X':10
'L':50
'C':100
'D':500
'M':1000

First Iteration: roman-to-integer-1.py
use zip function to loop both a and b at i and i+1 repectively and then compare those values for addition and subtraction.

        for a, b in zip(s, s[1:]):
            if numerals[a] < numerals[b]:
                res -= numerals[a]
            else:
                res += numerals[a]

        return res + numerals[s[-1]]
